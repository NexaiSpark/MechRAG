A RAG system for the mechanical design support

## Introduction
This is a RAG system for the mechanical design support. It is a web-based system that allows users to input their design requirements and receive feedback on the standard mechanical design. The system uses a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to analyze the design requirements and generate parametric solution.

## Features
- Input design requirements in natural language or image data
- Generate parametric solution on the design based on the requirements
- Export the design and feedback as a report
